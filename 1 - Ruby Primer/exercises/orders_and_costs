Problem Statement
A restaurant has incoming orders for which you need to compute the costs based on the mnu

You might get multiple orders at times.

Example:
if the order is {:rice => 1, :noodles => 1}, and the menu is {:rice => 3, :noodles => 2}, then the cost is 5.

if the orders are {:rice => 1, :noodles => 1}, and 
{:rice => 2, :noodles => 2}, and the menu is {:rice => 3, :noodles => 2}, then the cost is 15.
